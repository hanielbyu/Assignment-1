# UMPLIFY 
Umplify(fictional), is an ecommerce company for music goods and merchandise. Their original website 
is too messy, non responsive and not user friendly. My idea is to revamp their website to be more
aesthetically pleasing and responsive website. This is so that consumers who use 
the website will have a better and more convenient experience using the website. They will be able
to easily see whats on sale and recommended products that may spark interest in the consumer.

## Design Process
This website is for users that are interested in buying music related products. The minimalistic  
design for the website will make it easier for the users to use the website.The black and white shades of colour make the website feel more clean and premium look.
They will be able to navigate through the website with ease.
Options for navigation are clearly displayed and visible. The navbar is the same design throughout for consistency
For the home page, the contents in the page should spark the curiousity in users to browse through the website more 
with this design prompting them to click to find out more or to type their search in a search bar, will encourage that.
As for the display of products. It is displayed big with its product details shown with the price.
Login page has its content contrasted on the center of the page 



## Features
- Navbar has a search bar that can take texts input but it doesnt function onclick. The search bar is decorated with a button that highlights as you hover over the button
- The rest of the navbar is filled with nav hyperlinks/anchor tags that highlight when hovered to navigate and link through other web pages. VIEW CATALOG changes the page to a product catalog page. LOGIN changes the page to a Login form page. CART is placed there for concept purposes it does not link to any other page.
- The navbar is fixed hence while scrolling the navbar stays visble on the top of the page.
- The main home page consists of the big title that encourages users to SHOP for the company goods. A button is placed there named VIEW CATALOG to transfer page to the product catalog page. The button is styled in a brown colour with beige lettering to create visual aesthetic in the page. The button fills in colour as you hover with an ease transition.
-VIEW CATALOG displays a flex box justified to space between each box is filled like a card with the product details image, name and price. product cards highlight when hovered. The product cards when clicked, popup a modal that shows more details about the product with a closer look of the image as well as an add to cart button styled dark and bold. This is applicable to all product cards. 
- LOGIN page has a form card with inputs of email and password. I used javascript to develop a default admin email and password. Typing the correct input for email and password will result in returning to the home page with the indication on the navbar "Logout" implying that the user has logged in. Clicking on Logout will change back to the home page with nav bar having "Login" implying the user is currently logged out. 
- The Login card has remember me checkbox and forgot your password link. They are placed there for the concept purposes. There is also sign up link that pops up a different card for sign up/register Email and password can be inputted to be used to log in later on. if the password and confirm password match the sign up will be succesful You may click on the log in link below to revert back tot he log in card. 
- All pages are responsive including cards and modals. Responsive mode also includes a drop down navbar for navigation of anchor tags.
