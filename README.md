# UMPLIFLY 
Umplify(fictional), is an ecommerce company for music goods and merchandise. Their original website 
is too messy, non responsive and not user friendly. My idea is to revamp their website to be more
aesthetically pleasing and responsive website. This is so that consumers who use 
the website will have a better and more convenient experience using the website. They will be able
to easily see whats on sale and recommended products that may spark interest in the consumer.

## Design Process
This website is for users that are interested in buying music related products. The minimalistic 
design for the website will make it easier for the users to use the website. They will be able to navigate through the website with ease.
For the home page, the contents in the page should spark the curiousity in users to browse through the website more 
with this design prompting them to click to find out more or to type their search in a search bar, will encourage that.
